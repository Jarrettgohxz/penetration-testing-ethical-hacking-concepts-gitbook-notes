## Manual inspection of source code

From a manual inspection of the source code within burp suite, I found a comment:

It appears that the directories in this application uses the `hmr_` prefix.

## Directory discovery

I proceeded to perform a directory fuzzing with the `hmr_` prefix:

```bash
$ ffuf -u http://<target.com>:1337/hmr_FUZZ -w .../Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -mc 200,301,302
```

I visited the `/hmr_css`, `/hmr_images` and `/hmr_js` directories, and was presented with an index listing, but found nothing of interest.

However, the `/hmr_logs` displayed an `error.logs` file.

From the `error.logs` file, I found the email address: `tester@hammer.thm`. Very well, now lets use this email address on the reset password page.
