# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability

On the _**/admin/api**_ page (_**“API”**_ from dashboard), there appears to be admin instructions for us to retrieve sensitive credentials:

While on the _**/admin/settings**_ page (_**“Settings”**_ from dashboard), there appears to be a form for us to enter a URL. This hints us to change the URL to the localhost addresses given to us from the API page. From there, we will be able to retrieve a base64 encoded string of the sensitive content. We can use the terminal to decode the base64 encoded string:

```sh
$ echo <base64_string> | base64 -d
```
