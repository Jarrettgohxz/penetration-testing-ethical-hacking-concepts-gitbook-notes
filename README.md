# Introduction

_Hello readers!_

This Gitbook document summarizes my findings and learnings on various offensive security concepts, such as penetration testing, ethical hacking and red teaming, based on my knowledge and research. While I strive for accuracy, some notes may be incomplete or incorrect. I'm continuously updating and refining the content as I learn and gain new insights.

If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact me at [jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com](mailto:jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com). Your feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you!

Without further ado, let's hack away!

#### Important notice <a href="#shell-prompt-convention" id="shell-prompt-convention"></a>

1. You may notice that there are some empty pages/sub-pages with only a title. These pages are simply a work-in-progress, and functions as a way for me to remind myself on pending topics for research and experiments in the future.
2. The content present in this documentation is based on my understanding and research on that particular topic. Thus, some of the newly added content may not be entirely accurate, and will be refined over time as I experiment more on it.

#### Note on shell prompt convention <a href="#shell-prompt-convention" id="shell-prompt-convention"></a>

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate a shell prompt (defaulting to _Bash_). Some commands may require _root_ privileges via the `sudo` command. However, this documentation will not explicitly specify when `sudo` is required — it should be prepended where necessary.

#### Note on use of generative AI <a href="#shell-prompt-convention" id="shell-prompt-convention"></a>

> This document was supported by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which was used to generate ideas, provide validation, and clarify technical concepts.&#x20;

### Shell prompt convention

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate a shell prompt (defaulting to _Bash_). Some commands may require _root_ privileges via the `sudo` command. However, this documentation will not explicitly specify when `sudo` is required —  it should be prepended where necessary.
