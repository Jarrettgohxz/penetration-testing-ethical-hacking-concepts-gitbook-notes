# Leveraging alternate authentication materials

This section provides information of how to leverage alternate authentication materials such as NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets or key to access a Windows account. The techniques discussed applies to the following authentication methods:

1. [NTLM](https://jarrettgxz-sec.gitbook.io/windows/active-directory-ad/authentication-methods/netntlm) authentication
2. [Kerberos](https://jarrettgxz-sec.gitbook.io/windows/active-directory-ad/authentication-methods/kerberos) authentication

By using these methods, we can authenticate without knowledge of an actual user's password.
