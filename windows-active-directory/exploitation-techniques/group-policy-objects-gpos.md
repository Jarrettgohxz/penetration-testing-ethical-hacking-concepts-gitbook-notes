# Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings, represented by a unique name called a GUID. The GPOs of an AD network is usually stored in the **SYSVOL** directory: `\\domain\SYSVOL`, and can be viewed with:

```powershell
# From a domain-joined machine
C:\> dir \\domain\SYSVOL
```
