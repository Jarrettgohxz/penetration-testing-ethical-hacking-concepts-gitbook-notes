# Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings, represented by a unique name called a GUID. The GPOs of an AD network is usually stored in the **SYSVOL** directory: `\\domain\SYSVOL`, and can be viewed with:

```powershell
# From a domain-joined machine
C:\> dir \\domain\SYSVOL
```

### Group Policy Management

A mechanism to deploy a configuration from a central location, by defining policies directly on the AD structure for AD objects such as specific _OU_ or _group_. Domain-joined computers would then be able to pull all policies from **SYSVOL** periodically and apply relevant ones.

By default, policies are replicated every 15 minutes through the **gpupdate** application. However, we can manually trigger this application from the command prompt to apply policies instantly:

```powershell
C:\> gpupdate
C:\> gpupate /force
```
