3. **AD-RSAT** (Active Directory Remote Administration Tools)

> The Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell is a PowerShell module that consolidates a group of cmdlets. You can use these cmdlets to manage your Active Directory domains, Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) configuration sets, etc.

## Exploiting Access Control Entries (ACEs)

> An [access control entry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/SecGloss/a-gly) (ACE) is an element in an [access control list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/SecGloss/a-gly) (ACL). An ACL can have zero or more ACEs. Each ACE controls or monitors access to an object by a specified trustee.

There exists ACEs that can be exploited when delegated wrongly, by allowing us to perform dangerous actions:

a. **ForceChangePassword**: Set a user's password without knowing their current password

b. **AddMembers**: Add users (including our own account), groups or computers to a target group

c. **GenericAll**: Provides us with complete control over an object

* change user's password
* register an Service Principal Name (SPN)
* add an AD object to a target group

d. **WriteOwner**: Update the owner of a target object

* this means that we can make ourselves the owner, allowing us to gain additional permissions over the object

e. **WriteDACL**: Write new ACEs to a target object's Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)&#x20;

* for example, we could write an ACE that grants our account full control over a target object

f. **AllExtendedRights**: Perform any action associated with extended AD rights such as force changing a user's password

We could use Bloodhound to enumerate for dangerous permission delegations.
