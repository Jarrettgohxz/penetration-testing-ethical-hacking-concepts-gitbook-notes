### Terminologies

1. _Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (_**KRBTGT**)

* The service account for the Key Distribution Center (KDC) service
* This account is used to encrypt and sign all Kerberos tickets for the domain

2. Golden ticket

* A TGT is signed with the **KRBTGT** account's password hash
* Thus, with access to this hash, we will be able to forge a TGT for any user of our choice
* This ticket is known as a "_**Golden Ticket**_"

### Overview of exploiting domain trusts

In this attack, we abuse the trusts between domains in a forest.

#### General overview of the Golden Ticket attack

Refer to the "_**Terminologies**_" section above for more details on the Golden Ticket.

In a Golden Ticket attack, an attacker who has obtained the **KRBTGT** account hash for a domain can forge their own Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any user of their choice. This forged TGT, known as a Golden Ticket, is signed with the **KRBTGT** hash, making it appear valid to the domainâ€™s Key Distribution Center (KDC).&#x20;

This particular TGT can be used to request service tickets (TGS) for any service as the specified user, effectively gaining unrestricted access within the domain (eg. _Administrator_).
