### Terminologies

1. _Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (_**KRBTGT**)

* The service account for the Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC) service
* This account is used to encrypt and sign all Kerberos tickets for the domain

### Overview

In this attack, we abuse the trusts between domains in a forest.

...

In a Golden Ticket attack, an attacker who has obtained the **KRBTGT** account hash for a domain can forge their own Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This forged TGT, known as a Golden Ticket, is signed with the **KRBTGT** hash, making it appear valid to the domainâ€™s Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC). The attacker can then use this TGT to request service tickets (TGS) for any service, as any user, effectively gaining unrestricted access within the domain without detection.
