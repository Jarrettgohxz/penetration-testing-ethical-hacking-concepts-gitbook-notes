# PowerShell history

We can view the PowerShell history from the [PSReadline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/about/about_psreadline?view=powershell-7.5) module, which stores it in a file.

> PSReadLine provides an improved command-line editing experience in the PowerShell console.

The file can be found at:

```
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

For more information on the PSReadline options, we can run the `Get-PSreadlineOption` command.
