### Common options&#x20;

1. **Execution policies**

> PowerShell's execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. This feature helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

```powershell
C:\> powershell -eq Bypass
C:\> powershell -ex Bypass
```

* `Bypass`&#x20;
  * Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts
  * This execution policy is designed for configurations in which a PowerShell script is built into a larger application or for configurations in which PowerShell is the foundation for a program that has its own security model

Without the `Bypass` option, we will not be allowed to import a module (eg. `PowerView.ps1`) with the `Import-Module` command â€” to perform any relevant task.
