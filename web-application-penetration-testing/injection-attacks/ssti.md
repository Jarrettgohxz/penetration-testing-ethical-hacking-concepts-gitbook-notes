# SSTI

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is directly inserted into the template engine of a web application. Common template engines include Smarty (PHP), Jinja2 (Python), and Pug (formerly known as Jade) for Node.js.&#x20;

If an SSTI attack is successful, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), enabling attackers to escalate privileges and potentially achieve full compromise of the application.
