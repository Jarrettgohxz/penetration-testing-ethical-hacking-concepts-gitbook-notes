# Insecure deserialization

> Serialization is the process of transforming an object's state into a human readable or binary format (or a mix of both) that can be stored or transmitted and recontstructed as and when required. This is essential for data transfer between different parts of a system or across the network - such as in web applications.

For example in PHP using the `serialize()` function, we can convert the fields:

* `title` -> "My Note" and `content` -> Welcome to my note!

to a serialized format that looks like: `a:2:{s:5:"title";s:7:"My Note";s:7:"content";s:19:"Welcome to my note!";}`

### Black-box testing

1. **Access backup or temporary files**

* Append a tilde at the end of the filename (`~`)
* Can potentially leak information about serialization functions used



2. **Analyzing & manipulating request/response headers**

**Identifying and analyzing headers**

As serialized data are commonly base64-encoded in transmission, by observing base64-encoded values used in the request/response headers, we can identify serialized fields. These fields can be base64-decoded to retrieve useful information regarding the serialized object or data structures. This can inform us of any potentially vulnerable fields that can be exploited.

**Forcing error messages**

Moreover, the fields in the request headers can be altered/modified to invoke unexpected behavior that can present useful information through error messages. For example, certain PHP warnings may indicate the deserialization function used such as `unserialize()` , or may include an error message such as **Object deserialization error**, which will quickly inform us of the presence of serialized data, or the underlying serialization process and potential vulnerabilities.

The following shows commonly serialized response header fields:

a) ASP.NET view state: `__VIEWSTATE`&#x20;

b) Session cookies
