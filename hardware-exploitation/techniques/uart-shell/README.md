# UART shell

{% embed url="https://tcm-sec.com/getting-started-with-iot-hardware-hacking-uart/" %}

Most hardware devices exposes a "debug interface" shell via a UART port. This can allow us to gain access to a configured shell on the device, and my directly provide us with root access at times.

## 1. Identifying UART interfaces

a. Labels on the hardware itself

* "UART"
* "TX RX GND VCC"

b. Visual appearance

If there are no obvious labels on the device, we can still identify an UART interface by observing the following patterns

* 4-5 gold-plated holes/circular portions aligned in a neat row

## 2. Identifying pins on the UART&#x20;

After finding a potential UART candidate, we have to identify the TX, RX and GND pins to enable us to provide proper connections, and to prevent frying the components

### 2.1 Identifying _ground_ points on the board

But first, we have to find a ground point on the device (apart from the on the UART interface). For this, we need a digital multimeter

> _**IMPORTANT**_: **NEVER** use the continuity mode on a powered board

1. Turn the digital multimeter to continuity mode ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)



2. Touch both probes (connected to COM and mAΩA)

* “Beep” sound should be heard



3. <mark style="color:red;">**\*\***</mark>Turn **OFF** the power source to the device



4. Identify potential _ground_ points

* Large copper planes
* ~~Negative pin (-) of the DC power jack~~
* Pin labels with “GND” or “0V”



5. Touch both probes to 2 different potential Ground points

* If a “Beep” is heard -> both are Ground points

### 2.2 Identifying TX, RX and GND (UART)

#### 2.2.1 TX

#### 2.2.2 RX

#### 2.2.3 GND



## 3. Getting a shell

```shellscript
$ 
```
