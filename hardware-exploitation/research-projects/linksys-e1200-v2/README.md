## Learning outcomes



1. Techniques to gather information on a hardware without physical access to the device itself

* Google dork
  * Release notes, firmware download
  * Known CVEs&#x20;
  * PoCs for found CVEs
* FCC
  * Internal photos
  * Identifying presence of UART interfaces



2. Hardware interactions

* Identifying UART and potential GND points (visual inspection)
* Using the digital multimeter:
  * Identify GND points
  * Identify specific UART pins



3. Interacting with basic networking services on the device

* DHCP
* Nmap scan
* cURL, Netcat, etc.



4. How to gain a shell console from the UART interface + system enumeration

* Boot logs
* Firmware and OS versions, along with other useful information&#x20;
* Information gathering on a vulnerable binary



5. Techniques to interact with the device

* Simple techniques to reclaim memory space on the device
* Transfer files between device and host
* Provide additional access to the shell (dropbear SSH server)



6. Research of a vulnerable binary (from a known CVE)

* Understand the vulnerability from the CVE description
* Perform source code and HTTP traffic analysis
* Perform fuzzing, and analysis of the results to aid us in finding the _entry point_ of the vulnerability



7. Understand constraints and limitations of working with embedded devices, and explore workarounds to develop a working setup for reverse engineering + binary exploitation&#x20;

* Patch the binary with custom "breakpoint" instructions to control the program flow&#x20;
* Manual SIGSTOP signal to force a "pause"



8. Understand the _MIPS_ architecture & assembly&#x20;

* Work with exploit tools and techniques: pwn, Ghidra, GDB + gdbserver, objdump, etc.
* Utilize our understanding of the MIPS architecture/assembly to analyse register, memory contents, and many more important concepts



9. Reverse engineering and stack-based buffer overflow research&#x20;

* Demonstration of the steps taken to craft an initial payload to overwrite the return address and invoke a _denial-of-service (DoS)_
* Utilize GDB to analyse the crash, and build towards our final RCE payload&#x20;



10. Craft the final working RCE payload

* Understand common roadblocks such as stack layout constraints and bad characters, and how we can overcome these challenges with creative workarounds
* Craft the final payload to escalate the _controlled-crash_ into _Remote-Code Execution (RCE)_



11. Overall hands on experience working with well-known industry-standard application and tools that covers a wide range of tasks in a typical pentesting workflow

* **Network**: nmap, netcat, cURL,wget, Wireshark, etc.
* **Reversing + binary exploitation**: Ghidra, gdb/gdbserver, dd, etc.



12. **Bonus section**: post-exploitation + persistence techniques from a real-world perspective

*
