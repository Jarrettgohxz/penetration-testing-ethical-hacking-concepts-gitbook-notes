# 6. Post exploitation & Persistence

## 6.1 Gaining a shell (with additional binaries)



1. netcat
2. dropbear (ssh client)
3. socat

...&#x20;



## 6.2 Gaining a shell (without additional binaries)

...use existing binaries (busybox shell)

1. wget, telnet?
2. ...



## 6.1 Persistence techniques&#x20;

In this section, I will highlight techniques to gain persistence, and be able to maintain a foothold on the device across reboots/restarts. Our payload will usually run in memory. Thus, by applying a few persistence techniques, we will be able to write/update configurations on disk instead, which will persist across reboots/restarts.

...

1. nvram write
2. Cron jobs
3. ...



~~In this section, I outline the techniques to establish persistence on the device by creating a "backdoor" access to the system, that can be remotely accessed via the network~~

~~For this experiment, we will make the following assumptions:~~

1. ~~**Raspberry Pi**: C2 server that is hosted somewhere on the internet~~
2. ~~**Host machine**: attacker machine that gains initial access, and uploads the "backdoor"~~
