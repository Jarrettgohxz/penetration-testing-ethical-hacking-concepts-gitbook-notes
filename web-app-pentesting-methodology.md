### Reconnaisance/enumeration (active reconnaisance)

_**1.1 Directory discovery**_

**Manual**

* robots.txt
* sitemap.xml

**Tools**

* gobuster, wfuzz, ffuf, etc.
* ...

**Wordlists**

* usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/...
* /usr/share/wfuzz/...



Utilizing the word lists, common file extensions such as `.txt`, `.php`, `.pdf`, etc. can be appended  to discover specific named files.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -w ... -u https://example.com/path/FUZZ.txt # .txt
$ gobuster dir -w ... -u https://example.com/path/FUZZ.php # .php

```


{% endstep %}

b) ...



_**2.4 File upload vulnerabilities**_

a) Look for file upload features

b) Test with a valid input — observe the response

c) Test with malicious input such as `.php` extension — observe the response

...
