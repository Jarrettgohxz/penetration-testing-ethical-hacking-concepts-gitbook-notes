### 1. Little Endian

### 2. Stack grows downwards to lower memory addresses

### 3. Registers

#### 3.1 Special registers

a. `EIP`: Extended Instruction Pointer

* Stores the address of the current machine instruction

b. `EBP`: Extended Base Pointer

* Stores the address of the <mark style="color:$success;">**BOTTOM**</mark> of the current stack frame
* Used to create a stable reference point&#x20;
  * used as an offset to reference local variables

c. `ESP`: Extended Stack Pointer

* Stores the address of the <mark style="color:$success;">**TOP**</mark> of the current stack frame

#### 3.2 General-purpose registers

`EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `ESI` and `EDI`

> Note: the `e` prefix for the register naming stands for "extended". This indicates a 32-bit system (extended from the original 16-bit).

#### 3.3 EFLAGS registers

> The EFLAGS register hold the state of the processor. It is modified by many intructions and is used for comparing some parameters, conditional loops and conditionnal jumps. Each bit holds the state of specific parameter of the last instruction

The following lists the EFLAGS registers:

```markdown
Bit   Label    Desciption
---------------------------
0      CF      Carry flag
2      PF      Parity flag
4      AF      Auxiliary carry flag
6      ZF      Zero flag
7      SF      Sign flag
8      TF      Trap flag
9      IF      Interrupt enable flag
10     DF      Direction flag
11     OF      Overflow flag
12-13  IOPL    I/O Priviledge level
14     NT      Nested task flag
16     RF      Resume flag
17     VM      Virtual 8086 mode flag
18     AC      Alignment check flag (486+)
19     VIF     Virutal interrupt flag
20     VIP     Virtual interrupt pending flag
21     ID      ID flag
```

#### 3.4 Control, Segment, etc. registers

### Write/read operations on the stack

Since we are working with a 32-bit architecture, the increment/decrement value will be 4 bytes (32 bits). Additionally, remember that the x86 architecture grows the stack downwards to lower memory addresses.

**Pushing to stack (WRITE)**

When data is pushed to the stack (`push` command), the `ESP` is decremented by 4, before the CPU appends the data to the memory location found in the `ESP` .

**Reading (`pop`) from stack (READ)**

To retrieve data from the stack, the memory location value stored in the `EIP` will be retrieved, before being incremented by 4.&#x20;

> Note that the data stored in the memory location of the old `EIP` value (before increment) will still be present. However, due to the change of the `EIP` value, the data will be treated as if it has been removed, and subsequent writes will overwrite this value
