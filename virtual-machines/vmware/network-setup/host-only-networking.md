When VMware Workstation Pro is installed on a Windows or Linux host system, a host-only network will be set up by default. The virtual network interface name will be `VMnet1` by default. In a host-only network, the guest VMs and the host machine's virtual network adapter are connected to a prviate Ethernet network, which is completely contained within the host system. The virtual network adapter will be visible on the host OS, along with a DHCP server. The image illustration below shows the configuration:
