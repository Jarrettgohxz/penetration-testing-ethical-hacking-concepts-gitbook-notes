# Exploitable headers

### 1. `X-Forwarded-For`, `True-Client-IP`, `X-Client-IP`

Commonly used by CDN, proxy servers, etc. Informs the webserver of the originating IP address. However, this can be spoofed to trick the web server.&#x20;

### Potential XSS

For example, if the provided value is placed somewhere on the web-page, it can potentially lead to a XSS vulnerability if not filtered properly.&#x20;
