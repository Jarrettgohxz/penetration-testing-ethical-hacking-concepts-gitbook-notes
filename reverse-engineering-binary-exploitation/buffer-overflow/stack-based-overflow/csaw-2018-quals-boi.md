### Quick recap on x64 stack

1. The stack grows from high to low addresses

* The **RSP** moves to lower addresses to allocate space for new values (**RSP** value decremented)
* Value is written from lower to higher addresses
  * Eg. **0x123456**: 0x12 written first at the lowest memory address, followed by 0x34 and 0x56 at the highest address
  * Due to little endianess, the _LSB_ and _MSB_ are written at the lower and higher memory addresses respectively, resulting value: **0x563412**
