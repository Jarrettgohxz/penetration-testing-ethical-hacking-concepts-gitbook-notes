## 2. How it works

In ROP, we exploit instructions from libraries with fixed addresses (eg. `libc`) with a return statement at the end (eg. `ret`). These portions of code (known as "gadgets") are chained together to accomplish a sequence of tasks. For example, loading function arguments that eventually leads to remote-code execution (RCE).

Tools such as [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) can be used to simplify the process of looking for these "gadgets"
