# Python3

Suppose we want to create a binary input to pass as **stdin** into an executable we wish to test in GDB. Assume that the executable receives 2 inputs, the first will be a fixed string, while the second is a payload value that contains **0x10** bytes of the null character (`0x00`), followed by the raw bytes value `\x12\x34\x56\x78` &#x20;

```bash
$ python3 - << 'EOF' > payload.bin
import sys
# first input: fixed string
sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"fixed string value")

payload=b'0'*0x10
payload+=b'\x12\x34\x56\x78'

sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
EOF
```

* We can now supply the `payload.bin` file as input to the executable to test:

```shellscript
gdb> run < payload.bin
```
