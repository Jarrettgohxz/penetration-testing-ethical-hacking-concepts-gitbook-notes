# PIE

### Position-Independent Executable (PIE)

* A normal ELF executable (non-PIE) will have a fixed load address, and the type ET\_EXEC

```shellscript
readelf -h non_PIE_bin
Type:    EXEC ...
```

* A PIE executable behaves like shared libraries such that they must be position-independent
  * this means that all code uses RIP-relative addressing

```shellscript
readelf -h PIE_bin
Type:    DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)
```

#### Disable randomization

> Specifies whether GDB should disable the address space randomization provided by Linux kernel before starting the debugged program.

```shellscript
gdb> set disable-randomization on
gdb> set disable-randomization off
gdb> show disable-randomization
```
