# 6. Reverse engineering (exploit development)

Given the information we have gathered from the previous section, we can attempt to perform reverse engineering to replicate the steps taken to discover the CVE, and potentially escalate it to RCE.

> Note that the terms "router", "device" and "target" will be used interchangeably

## Note on console/shell environment

The commands in this section will be ran from 2 environments:

1. UART console (router): prefixed with a `#`&#x20;
2. External Linux machine: prefixed with a `$`
