I have found an article regarding MIPS ASLR bypass buffer overflow exploit: https://repository.root-me.org/Exploitation%20-%20Syst%C3%A8me/Unix/EN%20-%20Exploiting%20Buffer%20Overflows%20on%20MIPS%20Architectures%20-%20Lyon%20Yang.pdf



Validate my understanding of the flow:

1\. Buffer overflow observed which overwrites values in s0-s7 and ra

\- this happens because the stack regions which are restored to s0-s7 and the return address (ra) are being overwritten



2\. The binary is found to not have ASLR enabled for the target modules (libc in this case). Thus the modules will have the base address at a fixed location



3\. The ROP gadget generated attempts to call functions (at fixed addresses) from the libc library

\- first, we have to identify the location of the libc library address (will be fixed throughout execution runs)



4\. The ROP gadget consists of the following:

4.1 Use the fixed libc address +
